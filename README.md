# how to run?

1. run ```npm i``` to install all nodejs dependencies
2. config TypeScript and compile ```.ts``` to ```.js```
3. run ```node main.js```

(for development, I recommend nodemon for realtime hot-refresh, use ```npm i nodemon -g```and run ```nodemon main.js``` to start)

# Please notice!!
1.you should edit the ```utils/tool.ts```, and setup the key & iv of AES encryption(the same as front_end)
